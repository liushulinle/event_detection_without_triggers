Event Detection without Triggers (NAACL2019)
============================================

This repository provides the code for the work in NAACL2019: [Event Detection without Triggers](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1080).

Because of the copyright issue of ACE2005 Corpus, we can not release the corpus. For test, we give 10 samples in data/test_corpus_10.txt.

Each line represents a testing sample, whose format is as follows:
```
w1 e1 \t w2 e2 \t ... ... wn en \t evt1 evt2 ... evtm
```
where, [w1, w2, ..., wn] are tokens of a testing sentence, [e1, e2, ..., en] are the corresponding entity type of  each token, [evt1, evt2, ..., evtm] are the types of events mentioned in this sentence (if m is 0, this block will be replaced with a single 'NEGATIVE' label). 

We provide a trained model, which can be downloaded here: [model files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X9mP8z2mxehxM92VDMQQi4D_HGa4A38U). 

You can run this code to evaluate the trained model using the following command:
```python
python run_model.py evaluation 
```
or train the model using your own traininng corpus:
```python
python run_model.py train 
```

**Required running environment:**  
*1. python 2.7*  
*2. tensorflow 1.14*
